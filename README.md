I'm Aitana, a 20 year old Data Science student at the Universitat PolitÃ¨cnica de ValÃ¨ncia. Feel free to watch my repositories, though they're a bit messy. You'll find:
* Software project: It's the Software subsystem project from the Hyperloop UPV training center. In this project I've built a server for users to chat.
* Software project 2: It's the second Software subsystem project from HL UPV, In this project we can visualize real-time data from the POD simulator. 
* Valen Explora: This project is amazing. We've built an app in 3 months whose aim is to promote valencian towns trough technology. We want to show the users the attractiveness of these valencian towns with a game and reward system. 
* Autextification: It's a class project that consists on telling apart between AI generated and human generated texts.
