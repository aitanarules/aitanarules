I'm Aitana, a 20 year old Data Science student at the Universitat PolitÃ¨cnica de ValÃ¨ncia. Feel free to watch my repositories, even though I've haven't had enough time to reorganize them, you'll find:
* Software project: It's the Software subsystem project from the Hyperloop UPV training center. In this project I've built a server for users to chat.
* Artemis project: This project is amazing, but is secret at the moment. More details will be shown on May 2024
* Autextification: It's a class project that consists on telling apart between AI generated and human generated texts.
